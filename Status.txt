Leonardo Framba - Project 4 The program works as required. It compiles/runs and the
output matches the correct format to the letter. My program uses an additional helper
function called indexOf. This function returns the index of a given String in the list.
If the String is not found it returns the negative index of the position where the String
would have been if it was in the list. On a side note my program would benefit from having a
size counter in the list struct to keep track of the number of elemetns in the list.
